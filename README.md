# TaskFlow Help Center

This repository is a **portfolio project** demonstrating how I write and structure **end-user product documentation** for a SaaS help center using a docs-as-code approach.

> Confidentiality note: TaskFlow is a fictional product. Content is designed to reflect real help-center documentation patterns without using any client or proprietary information.

## Highlights

- User-first onboarding content (Getting started)
- Task-based guides (common workflows)
- Admin documentation (roles, permissions, security)
- Troubleshooting articles designed to deflect support tickets
- Release notes templates for product teams

## Audience

This help center is written for:
- End users managing daily work (projects, tasks, notifications)
- Workspace admins managing access, permissions, and security
- Support teams using articles to resolve common issues
