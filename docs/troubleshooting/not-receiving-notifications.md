**Applies to:** All users  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-03

## Overview
If you’re not receiving TaskFlow notifications (in-app or email), use the steps below to identify the cause and restore notifications.

## Symptoms
- You don’t receive notifications when someone assigns you a task
- @mentions don’t notify you
- Email notifications stopped arriving
- You receive some notifications but not others

## Step 1: Check notification settings
1. Go to `Settings > Personal settings`.
2. Select **Notifications**.
3. Confirm the following are enabled (based on your preference):
   - Assignments
   - Mentions
   - Comments
   - Project updates
4. Select **Save changes**.

## Step 2: Confirm you're the correct user
If you have multiple work emails, confirm you’re signed in with the same email address used in the workspace.

- Open your profile menu and verify the account email.

## Step 3: Verify email delivery (for email notifications)
1. Check spam/junk folders.
2. Search your inbox for “TaskFlow notification”.
3. Ask your IT/admin team if your organization blocks automated emails.
4. If you use an allowed domain list, confirm your email domain is permitted.

## Step 4: Check browser and device settings (for in-app notifications)
1. Refresh the page and sign out/in.
2. If using browser push notifications:
   - Confirm the browser allows notifications for TaskFlow.
   - Disable extensions that block popups/notifications.
3. Try an incognito/private window to rule out extensions or cached state.

## If the issue continues
Collect the following and share it with your workspace Admin or support:
- Your username/email
- Whether the issue is for email or in-app notifications
- Example task URL where you expected a notification
- Approximate time of the missed notification (with timezone)
