# Fix “search not returning results”

**Applies to:** All users  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-03

## Overview
If TaskFlow search is not showing expected results (or shows no results), try the steps below.

## Symptoms
- Search returns no results for items you know exist
- Search results are incomplete or outdated
- Search works for some projects but not others

## Quick fixes
1. Refresh the page and try the search again.
2. Check spelling and try a shorter keyword (for example, search `invoice` instead of `invoice redesign`).
3. Remove filters (project, status, assignee) and try again.

## Check access and scope
Search only returns content you have permission to view.

1. Confirm you have access to the project where the task lives.
2. If you’re a Viewer, ask an Admin to confirm your project access.

## Browser troubleshooting
1. Try an incognito/private window.
2. Disable browser extensions (especially ad blockers) and test again.
3. Clear site data for TaskFlow (cache/cookies) and sign in again.

## If the issue continues
Collect the following and share it with your workspace Admin or support:
- What you searched for (keyword)
- Which project you expected results from
- Time of the issue and your timezone
- Screenshot of the search results page
