**Applies to:** Workspace admins  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-11

## Overview
Roles control what users can view and change in a workspace.

## Default roles (example)
- **Admin:** Manage workspace settings, members, billing, and security
- **Member:** Create and manage projects and tasks (based on project access)
- **Viewer:** Read-only access to assigned projects

## Common permission questions
### Who can invite members?
Admins (and optionally project owners, depending on workspace settings).

### Who can manage billing?
Admins only.

## Best practices
- Assign Admin role only to trusted users.
- Use Viewer role for stakeholders who only need visibility.
- Review member roles quarterly to reduce access risk.
